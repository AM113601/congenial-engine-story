Once upon a time there was a character named Sbubby in the Kalos region.

Sbubby had a crazy good Aegislash on his team of Pokemon. He swept opposing trainers using Aegislash alone. However, Sbubby and his team were always facing very weak trainers in their hometown. He wanted to explore.

He ventured across the land in search of a true challenge, but none presented
themselves. When he was finally at his wits end, he turned back and began to
walk home, when suddenly...

A giant rubiks cube fell out of the sky. And with a big bonk, it landed on the sandy desert.
Its hugeness loomed over Sbubby, and also blocked his way home. It was super huge, like it
will take hours to get to the end of the rubiks cube. The huge figure seemed to beckon him
closer. It also  seemed that he will need to solve the color-mismatch on the cube to go home.
 That is fine, he thought, this might be the challenge he wanted.

Sbubby then spent the next two months trying to solve the rubiks cube. However, it was so complicated that it required a 200 IQ to solve. Not even his Aegislash, an Uber pokemon, could help him out.
In the end, sbubby rage quit and killed himself. The end.
